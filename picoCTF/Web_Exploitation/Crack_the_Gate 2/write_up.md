## 🧪 Description

> The login system has been upgraded with a basic rate-limiting mechanism that locks out repeated failed attempts from the same source. We’ve received a tip that the system might still trust user-controlled headers. Your objective is to bypass the rate-limiting restriction and log in using the known email address: ctf-player@picoctf.org and uncover the hidden secret.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
