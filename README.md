### 💡 "Teach me if you can!"
Since I am very new to this field, my solutions might not be the most efficient or "pro" ways to solve a problem. 
- **If you see a mistake, please correct me.**
- **If you have a better technique, please teach me.**
- **If you don't like my approach, I'd love to hear how you would do it better!**

I am always open to feedback and looking for mentors to help me grow. You can reach out by opening an **Issue** in this repository.
